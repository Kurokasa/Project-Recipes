    <h3>Zubereitung</h3>
    <p class="recipe">Cut the breadroll in half and put the top half to the side. Then add some majo to the lower half, dont add to much or it will spill out when you bite into it late. Lay the cutlet ontop, try to center it as best as possible, cut potential overhangs and add them to places where the breadroll is empty. Give it a crown with a Lettuce leaf and tomato slice, some people like to add onion slices or some cucumber. For the final step just put the second half of the breadroll ontop, press it down firmly and your done!</p>
